## Project Overview üöÄ
The project aims to streamline medical record management and enhance doctor-patient interactions using OCR, image analysis, and classification. It involves converting medical records into searchable PDFs, analyzing medical images, facilitating symptom-based document retrieval, transcribing and summarizing conversations, and generating prescription QR codes.

## Project Features and Functionality ‚ú®
- OCR Conversion: Convert medical records PDFs into searchable PDFs using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology.
- Image Analysis and Classification: Analyze medical images to classify conditions such as fractures and cancer using image analysis and classification techniques.
- Symptom-based Document Retrieval: Nurses use patient symptoms as keywords to search for relevant OCR'd documents, aiding doctors in diagnosis.
- Doctor's Interface: Present OCR'd records and image analysis results to doctors for informed decision-making during patient consultations.
- Transcription and Summarization: Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to transcribe and summarize doctor-patient conversations, facilitating efficient review.
- QR Code Prescription: Generate QR codes for prescribed medications, enabling easy scanning at pharmacies for medication fulfillment.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Provide a high-level overview of how our AI solution works. You can use diagrams or flowcharts to make it easier to understand. Explain the key components, data flow, and the AI/ML techniques utilized.


## Challenges and Solutions üß†
* Audio Separation and Deep Clustering: Initially, the project aimed to separate doctor-patient audio using spectrogram and deep clustering methods. However, due to complexity and resource limitations, implementing this in-house proved challenging.

Solution: As an alternative, an external API specializing in audio separation was integrated to achieve accurate separation of doctor-patient conversations.


## Future Enhancements üöß
* Blockchain Integration: Enhance data security and integrity by incorporating blockchain technology to create an immutable and tamper-proof audit trail for medical records.
* Real-time Collaboration: Enable real-time collaboration between doctors, nurses, and patients by integrating chat and video features into the platform.
* Predictive Analytics: Implement predictive analytics to assist doctors in making proactive treatment recommendations based on historical patient data.
* Integration with EHR Systems: Integrate with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems to streamline data sharing and improve the overall healthcare ecosystem.
